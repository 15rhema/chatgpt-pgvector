As a reminder, here are the training service objectives. Now we're not going to go over all of them today but these were thoroughly discussed in training number one so we do encourage you to watch the full series so that you have all the information because there is a lot of things that cross over from topic to topic. So far, we've covered three out of the eight trainings. We've covered background and implementation, VR expenditures, and pre</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t>-</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>employment transition services. Today we have a new presenter with us, I'm happy to announce Yann-Yann Shieh has joined us today. She is the statistician with the Data Collection and Analysis Unit with RSA and my name is Rachel Anderson and I am with the WINTAC. Today for our fourth training we're going to be covering the topic of supported employment services. Now just like we discussed in our training last time with pre</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t>-</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>employment transition services, this is not a training on content related to supported employment services. We are simply discussing how to report any SE services in the RSA-911. And if you need additional support in this area please contact either your RSA liaison or your WINTAC consultant for more assistance in this area. Some of the things we're going to talk about today related to supported employment are the whys behind the SE changes from policy directive 1604 to 1903. We're also going to talk about the required SE data elements and how to use them. We're going to discuss some of the quarterly reporting requirements related to SE services. title VI funds, actually title I funds as well. And then any other reporting elements that are related to supported employment like customized employment, extended services, and exit. And then as always, we'll cover what's coming up in the next four trainings. And we will share any tools and resources that we have for you related to supported employment. So we're going to start off with the why behind the changes. There are a lot of things that go into changing the reporting requirements for the program. So we're going to start with talking about some of the deleted changes, the why behind them, and then going into other things you need to know about reporting supported employment services. So I'm going to hand this off to Yann-Yann.</w:t></w:r></w:p><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">&gt;&gt; Hi everyone, this is Yann-Yann Shieh from RSA. The reason why we deleted RSA certain data elements related to the funding source for services is because we try to reduce </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve">the burden associated with the collecting of </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">RSA-911 </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t>data and the improved consistency</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> of reporting SE services across VR agencies. So in this slide we show three types of services categories, training services, career services, and other services. There are 12 data elements related to training services using title VI funds. Data elements 133, 140, 147, 154, 161, 167, 174, 181, 188, 195, 202, and 209. For example data element 140 is four years college or university training. Data element </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t>181 is</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> job readiness training. We also deleted eight data elements related to career services using title VI funds. Data elements 216, 223, 230, 237, 244, 251, 265, 272. For example data element 223 is diagnosis and treatment of impairments. Data element 272 is benefits counseling. Also RSA delete eight data elements related to other services using title VI funds. Data elements 291, 298, 305, 312, 319, 326, 333, </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t xml:space="preserve">340. For example, data element 291 is related to transportation services. Data element 326 is reader services. Next please. In short, SE services are VR services provided to an individual who is working in supported employment. To reduce burden and streamline the RSA-911 RSA deleted most of the data elements used to report specific VR services provided with title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">because this level of specificity is not necessary for reporting purpose. If a VR agency is providing a VR service using title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">to an individual working in supported employment, the service is reported using the more generic data elements for supported employment service using title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">under PD 19-03. Because the use of title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>can begin only when an individual with the most significant disability is placed in an employment position requiring SE services this means that all federal expenditures for that individual which occur prior to the individual being placed in employment must be provided with the title I VR fund. Next please. RSA also deleted these specific data elements so that it was clear in the RSA-911 that supported employment services using title I or title VI funds, may only be provided once the participant begins working.</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> In the past the RSA has seen</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> agencies has been reporting VR services using title VI</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> funds</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>, using the now deleted data elements p</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="008B15D8"><w:t>rior to employment. Key to these</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> points, key to remember for this slide is for individuals with most significant disability agency use title I funds to provide VR services to individuals before they are working or after they start working. Agency cannot provide supported employment services to individuals who are not working. Supported employment services can only occur if there is an employment. Once the individual begins supported employment agency may use title I or title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00687CDB"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">to provide supported employment services. Again title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00687CDB"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>cannot be used before the individual starts working in supported employment. Next ple</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00687CDB"><w:t>ase. There are some critical</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> data elements required for individuals who receive supported employment services. First, in order to receive supported employment services an individual must have a most significant disability and be a participant of the VR program. To be a VR program participant an individual must have an a</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>pplication date, eligibility date, IPE date, start initial VR service date</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>, and e</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>xit date</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>. For PD 19-03 RSA deleted data element 48, day of the most recent of amended IPE. So to be a participant now we have to include the data elements 398, day of initial IPE day. In data element 45 the VR agency reports the individual as being most significantly disabled. These d</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>ata elements must be coded as 2-</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidRPr="001558BC"><w:t>individual</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> is most significantly disabled required for SE services. And this data element is reported quarterly for each individual or participant and report at the time of disability data element. Next. One important data element for individual to receive SE services is data element 49, supporting the employment goal on current IPE. In order to receive SE services an individ</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>ual must also have supported</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> employment goal on their current IPE.</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> D</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>ata element 49 the VR agency reports if the individual has an SE goal on their current IPE. Report at the time of IPE or amended, report q</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>uarterly for each participant. D</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">ata element is updateable for this element. And code values if they receive the SE services must be code 1, individual has an SE goal on current IPE. So please remember RSA add a new data element, data element 398 called date of initial IPE and delete the data element 48, day of most recent or amended IPE. Regardless of which IPE the </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t xml:space="preserve">individual </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">has this data element 49 must be code 1 so the individual </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t>can receive SE services. Next please. Another important data element related to SE services and use of the title VI fund</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>s</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>is data element 350 starting date</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> of employment in primary occupation. Supported employment services and use of the title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">start after the participant with a most significant disability is employed. And remember title VI </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t xml:space="preserve">funds </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">cannot be used before the individual starts working in supported employment. In data element 350, the VR agency reports the start date of employment in their primary occupation. This data element is reported at the time of employment outcome related to participant's IPE goal must be in the same quarter or prior quarters </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>to individual receiving</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> SE services. This data element is updateable. The date must be verifiable through supporting documentation. For example, paystub identifying the individual starting date, detailed case notes signed by counselors in the case service record or verification received from employer, including date of verification </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>or copy of the email, fax or letter</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>. In the next slide Rachel will give you a summary of when SE services may be provided. Pass to Rachel.</w:t></w:r></w:p><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"><w:r><w:t>&gt;&gt; Thanks Yann-Yann. So this is just a quick summary visual of what Yann-Yann just discussed. So you do have the option under supported employment services to use both title VI and title I funds. But supported employment services are only provided to individuals once they have those three things that Yann-Yann talked about. So first, they must be an individual with a most significant disability. They also have to have supported employment goal on their IPE. And then they also must be employed. So once all three of those things are documented in the RSA 911 that's when the agency can start providing supported employment services and are allowed to use title VI funds or can also use title I funds</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>,</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> if necessary. So we just wanted to make sure that that's very clear because we know that supported employment can be very confusing for agencies especially because the services themselves may be a little bit different than when and how you use the different funding sources. So this is just a little summary example of what Yann-Yann talked about and we're going to be providing more examples as we go on. So I do want to turn it back to Yann-Yann and she's going to discuss the specific service data elements for supported employment.

Next slide. Supported employment services are ongoing support services, including customized employment and other appropriate services needed to support an individual with a most significant disability maintaining supported employment. In g</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>eneral, there are three methods</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> for agencies to provide each service and report to RSA 911. Agencies can use more than one method to provide each service. They can use ei</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="001558BC"><w:t>ther in-house agency staff,</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> purchase or comparable service benefits. The data elements 254 to 260 is related to SE servi</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00420BAF"><w:t>ces using these three methods.

And if data element is updateable report at the time of services provided, if no in-house service just leave blank for this data element. Next please. Data element 255 and 256 are talking about the services provided by agency purchases. If agency purchase SE service data element 255 mus</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00B82FEB"><w:t xml:space="preserve">t code 1.

If code 1 is data element 255 then 256 cannot be blank, 256 is related to SE service purchased service provider type. There are four types of service code agency, service provide code agency can choose. One is public community rehab program CRP, private CRP, other public service provider, other private service provider. So this data element 256 is also updateable if the service like I said 256 cannot be blank if 255 code is 1. Leave blank if service was not provided through purchase by VR agency and for each service category, we put the code value that best describes the primary service provider. Next please. If agency report 255 and 256 this slide </w:t></w:r><w:proofErr w:type="gramStart"/><w:r><w:t>show</w:t></w:r><w:proofErr w:type="gramEnd"/><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> 257 and 258 must be reported, 256 relat</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00B82FEB"><w:t>e here to amount of VR fund expe</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>nded for service, means this is title I fund, 258 refers to title VI</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00B82FEB"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> funds</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">.

The last method agency can provide SE services using a comparable service or a comparable benefit provider. If this method is used data element 259 must be code 1.

Rachel back to you.</w:t></w:r></w:p><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"><w:r><w:t>&gt;&gt; Thanks Yann-Yann. Okay so we do want to discuss customized employment services because as you know it is a strategy for supported employment that many states are trying to implement. And there are specific data elements to report in the RSA 911. So we're going to talk about the data elements and I</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00313718"><w:t>'m going to attempt to clear up</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> maybe some of the reporting confusion with when to use supported employment Service data elements and when to use customized employment </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t>services data elements. We do also h</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00313718"><w:t>ave the customized employment CF</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>R reference for you, it's 34 C.F.R. 361.5(c</w:t></w:r><w:proofErr w:type="gramStart"/><w:r><w:t>)(</w:t></w:r><w:proofErr w:type="gramEnd"/><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">11). Okay so in the RSA 911 the customized employment services data elements are 275 through 281. And this is where you document customized employment services which are designed to meet the specific abilities of each individual with a significant disability and the business needs of the employer, and carried out through flexible strategies such as job exploration. So just like Yann-Yann talked about with supported employment there are the three types of ways you can provide customized employment services. So VR in-house, you can provide them through a purchase service provider, and through comparable benefits. So we have outlined the 911 elements, again these charts look exactly like the ones Yann-Yann just went over so I won't give all the detail that she did because it's the same thing. But here we've got listed data element 275 which is where you would document customized employment services provided in-house. Next, we've got data element 276 and 277, this is where we would document if a customized employment Service was provided through a purchased service. As Yann-Yann said, if you document that they were provided in whole or by part by a purchase service then you also must document the purchase service provider type in 277 and the choices are the same as Yann-Yann discussed with SE. Next, we've got the data element for the funding sources. So you do have the option in PD 19-03 to provide customized employment services using title I or title VI funds. Now remember the requirement is different if you use title VI funds. You also have to make sure that the person has a supported employment goal on their IPE and they've been placed in an employment setting. So this does get very confusing on services that you're providing prior to employment and after employment with customized. So and I'm going to give you an example of that in just a minute. Next, you also have the ability to provide these customized employment services through a comparable benefit. So we've used the same examples that we previously gave you for supported employment. For customized employment it's data element 280 for the comparable benefit being provided by -- in whole or by part and then 281 is who the provider type is. As Yann-Yann discussed appendix 5 has been modified for PD 19-03 so we do encourage you to review the list of those and we've given you some common examples of code 12 with the intellectual and developmental disability agencies and code 14 would be mental health providers. Those are some of the more common providers of supported employment and customized employment services. So supported employment services versus customized employment services and I'm going to try not to botch this because it does get pretty confusing. So customized employment services for those of you that are familiar with those types of services, they can be provided prior to employment. Often, we've got the discovery phase, you might have some internship activities, you might have placement activities. So an agency can use customized employment Service data elements prior to employment. Those would be using title I funds because they're provided prior. But remember as Yann-Yann discussed earlier, you don't use supported employment funds or provide those services until somebody has been placed in employment. So we've got a couple of specific bullet points for you here, I'm going to read them to you just to make sure they are very clear. So both title I and title VI funds can be used to provide supported employment services and customized employment </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t>services. However VR agencies may only use title VI funds to provide supported employment and customized employment services after the participant with a most significant disability is employed. Also VR agencies report all SE services using the SE data elements 254 through 2</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00FD3930"><w:t>60 that Yann-Yann discussed which</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> can include any service needed to maintain or support the individual's employment. VR agencies can choose to use customized employment data elements so I just discussed 275 through 281 to specifically document use the customized employment services provided during supported employment. So just to break it down a little bit clearer, you can use customized employment data elements if you want to. There are many agencies that are implementing pilot programs or very strategic plans for customized employment. If the agency wants to track those and document those efforts, please use the customized employment data elements. However you can also simply document those as supported employment services like we've talked about before. So we do have a visual example that I want to show you. So very first, the person has to be a participant so they are eligible for the VR program, they have an IPE, and they began receiving s</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00FD3930"><w:t>ervices. And they have their MSD</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> and they have supported employment goal on the IPE so that's kind of where we start with supported employment. While they are looking for employment before they're placed in a job you might provide restoration services, training services, job placement services, and maybe you provide customized employment services. Because all of those are prior to employment you would be using title I funds. Now for those of you that are not providing customized employment or maybe have some of those specific strategies you might just be documenting their restoration, training, and job placement data element in the 911. For those of you that are using some customized employment strategies maybe you use the customized employment data elements instead of those other ones. But the most important thing is to remember that you can only use title I funds for any of those services prior to employment. Then once the individual becomes employed the person who is MSD and the person who had supported employment on their IPE. Once they're employed and document -- that's documented in data element 350 that Yann-Yann talked about, then we can start providing supported employment services and or customized employment services using title VI funds and you can also use title I funds for that. And I do have a little reminder there for you too because this is confusing so hopefully this visual helps. We're going to get into a more specific example toward the end but hopefully this chart helps you understand supported employment services are only provided if they're MSD, if they have a goal on the IPE, and if they're employed. And that's also when you can use title VI funds so. Okay Yann-Yann I'm going to turn it back over to you to talk about extended services for you</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00FD3930"><w:t>th</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>.</w:t></w:r></w:p><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"><w:r><w:t>&gt;&gt; Okay thank you Rachel. So the following slide related to Extended services for Youth with MSD, the citation is 34 C.F.R. 361.5(c)(19). Next slide please. Like I said earlier, RSA service categories provides there are three ways. However</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00663E82"><w:t>,</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> in extending services there are only two ways of services provided, either in-house agency staff </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t xml:space="preserve">provided </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00663E82"><w:t>or</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> purchases. Data element 282 is related to service provided by VR agency staff in-house. And extended services are ongoing support services and other appropriate services that are needed to support and maintain employment for youths with a most significant disability. These extended services only apply to youth with a most significant disability. If you code 1 in data element 282, this data element is updateable, and report at the time the service is provided to the youth with most significant disability. And this is in-house provided. Next please. The other method that you can provide extended services to youth with the most significant disability is through agency purchase. Data elements 283 and 284 are required. If data element 283 you choose one service was provided in whole or in part through purchase by the VR agency. And then data element 284 must be documented, you have to provide some purchase service provider report to RSA. Four choices, public CRP, private CRP, other public service provider, other private service providers. And this is the same, both data elements are updateable and report the data elements upon occurrence. Next pleas</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00663E82"><w:t>e. Okay if you have 280 prior two</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> data elements purchased services then we have to provide funding source. Data element 285 is related to extending the service amou</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00663E82"><w:t>nt of VR fund, title I fund expe</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">nded for service. So you report up to six-digit integer, no decimal point and report at the time the expenditure is paid. Like I said before, if service is in Q1 and payment is in Q3 report data element 285 in Q3. Then the other funding source for extended service is using title VI funds. Remember it's very important if you use title VI funds </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>recipients of these funds</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> must have a supported employment goal in their IPEs and they have already been placed in an employment setting. Al</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>so this can only be used to youth</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> with most significant disability. I focus on more time on these. Next please. So this slide shows a summary of the reporting requirements for extended services. VR agency report extended services provided to youth with the most significant disability. Youth means age 14 through 24 provided by VR agency staff or through VR agency purchase prior to exiting from the VR program. If they exit out from the VR program extended services cannot be provided. Extended services may be provided to youth using both title I and title VI</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> funds</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">. VR agencies do not use title I or title VI funds to provide extended services to individuals other than youth with the most significant disability. Some VR agencies may have state appropriations or other funding sources to provide extended services to other populations. VR agencies do not report data for participants including youth who have achieved a supported employment outcome and are receiving extending services provided through other sources after exiting from the VR program. </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>So remember this one is</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t xml:space="preserve">prior </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>to exiting from the VR program, this extended services. Next slide. So once the services are provided during the VR process and the next one is for the exit data el</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>ements related to supported</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> employment outcomes, we want to see whether the individual with the most significant disability achieve SE CIE outcome or not. The citation here is 34 C.F.R. 361.5(c)(53). Next slide. There are several data elements related to the exit data elements for individuals who receive SE service and achieve SE CIE. First, if the individual achieves the supported employment outcomes in competitive and integrated setting then we nee</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>d to report data element 353 date</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> of the exit. Report the date of the individual exit from the VR or SE program consistent with the requirement in the regulation. The date must be verifiable through </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t xml:space="preserve">supporting documentation. Once you have a date of exit then you need to report to </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>RSA</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> for data element 354, type of exit. This scenario is the individual with MSD and receive </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t xml:space="preserve">SE </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>service then</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> code value 6, individual exits after a </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">signed IPE </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t xml:space="preserve">in </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">competitive and integrated setting or supported employment. Code must be reported here. Data element 355, reason for program exit. Please refer to appendix 6 in PD 19-03 reason for exist. Once the individual achieves SE CIE code value 14 must be reported, achieved the competitive integrated employment outcome. Next slide. So we have date of exit type of exits and reasons for exit. </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>Other</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> we have to report what type of job, the earnings</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="002E2232"><w:t>, and hours worked to RSA</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>. So data element is 356, employment outcome at exit in PD 19-03 code 5 need to report. Code 5 is supported employment in competitive integrated employment. We cannot use the code value 1 competitive integrated employment because we are talking about an individual with most significant disability with SE goal on their IP</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00754A8C"><w:t xml:space="preserve">E and received SE services. So employment outcome </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>at the exist must use code 5 here. Then we need to know what type of job the individual achieves at the CIE 2018 SOC code that best describes the individual's occupation consistent with the IPE goal must be reported under DE 357, primary occupation at exist. The next data element 359, hourly wage at exit. Report individual's hourly wage earned at the time of exit. This data must be verifiable through supporting documentation. We know the wage, now we need to learn how many hours the individual worked in the week at exit. So data element 360, hours worked in a week at exit. We report the number of hours the individual worked for earnings in a typical week at the time of the exit. The next slide other scenarios that Rachel will talk about. Back to Rachel.</w:t></w:r></w:p><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve">&gt;&gt; Thank Yann-Yann. So Yann-Yann just finished describing to you the codes that you should be using when closing someone who received supported employment services in competitive integrated employment. So at time of exit if they received supported employment and they were working in competitive integrated employment those are all the things that need to be reported. However as you know in RSA 911 there are many other codes that you may use to describe why someone exited the program. So we did want to just take a second and point out some of the other supported employment exit codes. Now keep in mind we're not going to go into too much detail here but our training number six that we're doing in this training series is going to discuss exit and post-exit data elements so we may go into a bit more detail at that time. So for data element 355, this is the reason for program exit. So there are other codes in PD 19-03 and 16-04 to use when they did not achieve competitive integrated employment. So appendix 6 in both 16-04 and PD 19-03 include code value 16 so it has not changed from each of the policy directives. And that's when an individual has received VR services but requires long-term extended services for which no long-term source of funding is available. And this code is only used for individuals who have received VR services so someone that you'd be closing after they were a participant in an IPE. And the in PD 19-03 specifically RSA added code value 20, this is for the short-term basis period. So the individual the reason they exited the program was because the individual achieved </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t xml:space="preserve">supported employment and integrated employment but did not earn a competitive wage after exhausting the short-term basis period. Now </w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00CA06CE"><w:t xml:space="preserve">this </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>may not apply to your agencies, many agencies don't use the short-term basis period. So if that's true for your agency then you wouldn't be using this code. However if your agency is using short-term basis periods and exhausting those timeframes then you would use this code if it did not result in competitive integrated employment. And moving on data element 356, employment outcome at exit. In the new policy directive 19-03 RSA deleted code value 6 for supported employment on short-term basis. And so that one it said it referred to supported employment outcome while working toward competitive integrated employment on a short-term basis. But you'll see that they deleted the code value for 356 here but that's why they added code value 20 to reason for exit. And so it's worded a little bit differently and it was moved to a different data element but the short-term basis period to meet the regulations still</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00CA06CE"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> lives in the RSA 911. So now</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> we want to go into a couple more examples before we wrap up today's training. Again it can get really confusing on how and when to use these codes and I think that it can be confusing on where you do have options. So we just wanted to give more detailed examples similar to the example I used earlier in the training. So if you have an individual, they're a VR participant with a most significant disability and they have supported employment goal on their IPE while they're working up toward employment. Maybe this individual received diagnostic and treatment for let's say it was the data element 185, maybe they purchased some physical therapy for the person and then they would document data element 186 for the provider type. But because this was happening, this restoration service was happening prior to employment we would use data element 187 and use funds expended using title I funds. So another service on the IPE might be job readiness training. This training service and they might be documenting data element 178 for the purchase service, maybe it was through a CRP for the job readiness, and they would also document the provider type. And then again data element 180 title I funds would be documented because this is helping the person prepare for employment, it's not supported employment services yet. Then we also provided the job placement assistance, so this would be data element 241. And the same thing maybe it's purchase service provider, maybe the provider type for 242</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00CA06CE"><w:t xml:space="preserve"> is a CRP. And then again, they are</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> actual placement services which are happening prior to employment. So data element 243 would be used for title I funds and we have not started providing SE or title VI funding yet. And now because of all those amazing services you provided under an IPE the person has gained employment. So then we would document data element 350 as Yann-Yann said which is the start date of employment. At that time we can start providing supported employment services. So at this time it's kind of like if the individual needs any services at that point to help them for ongoing support services or other appropriate services needed to support the individual in maintaining their supported employment they would be documented under those generic codes of supported employment, so 254 through 260. So you might be using those data elements under supported employment services to provide job coaching services, that's probably the most common SE service. They also might need transportation support. They also might need additional treatment support to continue maintaining their supported employment. </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t>And maybe they need benefits counseling at that time too. And so all of those services, those are just examples, but all of those services could be documented and reported in the 911 as supported employment services using data elements 254 through 260. And you can use title VI funds for those services. You can also use title I funds at that point. And you know some agencies will go back and use title I funds for transportation and use those data elements which would be okay too. But on in order to use title VI funds you would have to provide those as an SE service. So just in wrapping it all up together we just wanted to do a little bit of a summary. So in order for an agency to accurately report the provision of supported employment services it does require multiple data elements. So first off, the individual has a most significant disability and they're ident</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00CA06CE"><w:t>ified as receiving SE services w</w:t></w:r><w:r><w:t>hen there's a supported employment goal on the IPE. At that point all applicable IPE and participant data elements are reported, we've talked about those pretty in depth in some other trainings as well. And then when particip</w:t></w:r><w:r w:rsidR="00CA06CE"><w:t>ants begin employment that's when</w:t></w:r><w:bookmarkStart w:id="0" w:name="_GoBack"/><w:bookmarkEnd w:id="0"/><w:r><w:t xml:space="preserve"> SE services are reported. So after someone has actually gotten their employment. The appropriate funds, either title I or title VI, are reported as funds expended on all SE services. And then in subsequent quarters, VR must report all applicable data elements including the provision of any supported employment services and funds. And then also like we just talked about, it they happen to receive extended services once they exit the program you would report any of those applicable exit data elements to kind of wrap up the supported employment reporting for that individual. We want to finish today's training with internal controls. So just keep in mind here; here are a couple of specific areas that you need to ensure internal controls exist. So internal controls should ensure accurate tracking and reporting of all SE services. Internal controls should ensure that extended services are provided only to youths 14 through 24 with the most significant disabilities. Your internal controls should also prevent agencies from providing supported employment services to individuals who are not MSD and do not have an SE as a goal on their IPE. And that also includes the use of title VI funds. So many of you likely have internal controls in your case management system to prevent some of those errors. So that would be something to think about as you're getting a new system or as you're making adaptations to make sure that those controls exist and your policies and procedures and everything else that you have in place. And then lastly, internal controls should prevent agencies from using title VI funds to provide any services prior to employment. So as you can see RSA helps you with those controls a little bit by making changes from 1604 to 1903. They pulled all the title VI funding data elements from all of the services prior to employment and only allow you to use those funds for supported employment services. So they tried to help you out with that one a little bit but there are still a lot of things that your agency needs to make sure on the internal control side as well. So we are happy to report we are halfway through this training series. So our next training will be on measurable skill gains and credential attainment. And then our sixth training which will wrap up December will be exit and post-exit data elements. And then we will let you know what's coming next in January. Here are your resources for today, some of them are the same. There is the comment analysis from the ICR, this discussed a lot of the changes that Yann-Yann and I discussed today so if you're interested in </w:t></w:r><w:r><w:lastRenderedPageBreak/><w:t>reading the discussion on that. We also continue to provide the link for 16-04 and 19-03 because it can get very confusing on the current version versus preparing for the implementation. So just want to make sure you still have those two links. And then also today we added the RSA FAQ about SE. This is a program side FAQ to help you if you don't have this. Here is Yann-Yann's information and mine and as always continue to reach out to your RSA liaison, to RSA data if you have reporting questions or also your WINTAC liaison if you need more support. We know we didn't cover or answer all of your questions on supported employment and how to interpret or provide any of these services but we do hope that you have a little bit more understanding on when you're providing supported employment services how you document them in the RSA 911. So Yann-Yann do you have anything else to add?</w:t></w:r></w:p><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"/><w:p w:rsidR="00EB14CF" w:rsidRDefault="00EB14CF" w:rsidP="00EB14CF"><w:r><w:t>&gt;&gt; Yeah, like Rachel say if you have any additional questions or some confusion please reach out to me and Rachel or your state liaison, we will answer your questions.
